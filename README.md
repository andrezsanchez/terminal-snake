# Terminal snake

A snake game that runs in the terminal.

There is a server-client architecture. It is not really necessary, but I am interested in allowing
for multiplayer gameplay at some point.

# Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/andrezsanchez/terminal-snake.git
cd terminal-snake
make
```

This has only been tested on my Macbook Pro.

# Play

Run the server by running `./server`, then in another terminal, run `./main`
